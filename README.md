# IMDb-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP
Sentiment analysis, often known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) method for identifying the positivity, negativity, or neutrality of data. Businesses frequently do sentiment analysis on textual data to track the perception of their brands and products in customer reviews and to better understand their target market.

The process of identifying positive or negative sentiment in text is known as sentiment analysis. Businesses frequently employ it to analyse social media data for sentiment, evaluate brand recognition, and grasp customers.

Problem Statement
The main objective in this Project is to predict the sentiment for a number of movie reviews obtained from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews that have been pre-labeled with “positive” and “negative” sentiment class labels based on the review content. Besides this, there are additional movie reviews that are unlabeled.

Hence our task will be to predict the sentiment of 15,000 labeled movie reviews and use the remaining 35,000 reviews for training our supervised models.
